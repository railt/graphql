# Compilation process

## Compilation 

1) Early static binding (Each type definition explicitly associates it with a name).
2) Creates the execution context.
3) Provides information about the location of the structure definition.
4) Provides information about dependencies.
5) Provides information about nested structures.
6) Loading missing records.
7) Execution the instructions.

## Runtime

1) Late dynamic binding (Linking dependencies to their definitions).
2) Execution the extensions.
3) References verification.
4) Assembling the resulting program (Enhanced Introspection Structure).
